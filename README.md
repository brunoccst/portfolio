[![Portfolio CI/CD](https://github.com/brunoccst/portfolio/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brunoccst/portfolio/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This repository contains my personal portfolio.

## Structure

This repository only has one project, `portfolio.web` - a React + TypeScript + Vite project.
It contains the actual published web app.
Visit its [README](/portfolio.web/README.md) for more information on how to run it.
