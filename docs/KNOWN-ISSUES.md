Things that are wrong, incomplete, or that will surprise someone reading the

## Content

### Only the DocuWare entries are corroborated

The content was written from the CV. The LinkedIn profile could not be fetched —
it is behind a login wall and returns a sign-in page to any unauthenticated
request — so the cross-check was done from screenshots supplied by hand, and
they covered only the DocuWare roles and the tail of the MECOMO one.

Those entries are now accurate and the CV was wrong about them: it listed a
single DocuWare role of "Software Engineer" running to the present, when the
role became Team Lead in April 2024. Everything before November 2020 still rests
on the CV alone, and the CV has already been demonstrated to lag reality.

### The MECOMO entry flattens four roles into one

LinkedIn lists four consecutive roles at MECOMO AG: junior engineer at the
Brazilian subsidiary from May 2016, a year at the German headquarters from
January 2018, a year back in Brazil from December 2018 to finish the degree, and
a return to Germany from November 2019 until the move to DocuWare.

The site shows one entry for the whole span. The four differ mainly by which
office the work happened in, and the site gives locations at country level only,
so splitting them would produce near-identical rows distinguished by a detail
that has deliberately been removed. The promotion from junior is carried in the
summary text instead.

The cost is that the entry no longer shows the shape of the progression, and a
reader comparing the site against LinkedIn will find four roles there and one
here.

### The MECOMO technology list is still the CV's

LinkedIn's junior-engineer entry ends with "The tech stack included:" and the
list itself was cut off in the supplied screenshot. The tags on that entry are
therefore still the CV's, unverified, while its prose has been corrected.

### No images or icons in the sections

The section components render text only. Nothing is in place for a photo, a
company logo or the icons the Links section will eventually want.

## Interaction

### A panel that barely overflows eats a whole gesture

The content panel takes priority over section changes whenever it has room to
scroll — including when it has three pixels of room. In that case one wheel
gesture is spent scrolling those three pixels and a second is needed to change
section.

It is visible today: at 1280×720 the Experience section overflows by about five
pixels.

A minimum-overflow threshold would fix the gesture but would make those few
pixels of content unreachable. The real fix is section content that either fits
comfortably or overflows clearly.

### Scroll hijacking is an unusual interaction

Taking over the wheel is what the brief asked for, and the keyboard and touch
paths are covered, but it still breaks the expectation that a wheel scrolls a
page. Visitors using an input device that reports unusual `deltaY` values — some
free-spinning mice, some remote-desktop clients — may find the 60px threshold
either too easy or too hard to reach.

### Browser history fills up

Every section change is a `navigate()` call that pushes a history entry.
Scrolling from About me to Links and back leaves four entries, so the Back button
walks through them one at a time rather than leaving the site.

Using `replace` for scroll-driven changes and `push` for clicks would be closer
to what people expect, but it makes the Back button unable to return to a
previous section at all. Neither behaviour is clearly right; the current one is
at least predictable.

### No swipe distinction between vertical scroll and section change on touch

The touch handler only measures vertical travel. A diagonal swipe that is mostly
horizontal still counts toward a section change if its vertical component
crosses 56px.

## Build and dependencies

### Material UI is a large dependency for two buttons

`@mui/material`, `@mui/icons-material` and their Emotion dependency produce a
vendor chunk of roughly 162kB (about 56kB compressed) to render two icon buttons
and two tooltips. That is most of the third-party JavaScript on the page.

The trade was made knowingly — see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) — but it is the
single largest performance cost in the project.

### No tests

There are no unit, component or end-to-end tests. `useSectionNavigation` and the
route-swapping state machine in `ContentPanel` are the two pieces where a
regression would be easy to introduce and hard to notice.

---

## Internationalisation

### Region variants collapse to the base language

`pt-BR` and `pt-PT` both resolve to `pt`, and the Portuguese file uses Brazilian
spelling and vocabulary ("Líder de Equipe & Engenheiro de Software"). A visitor
in Portugal gets Brazilian Portuguese.

### The language toggle assumes exactly two languages

`SystemControls` switches between English and Portuguese with a lookup table. A
third language would need the control replaced with a menu.

## Layout and styling

### The pipe separator disappears below 768px

On narrow screens the heading stacks the name over the role and hides the `|`
between them. The intro replaces it with a short horizontal rule; the heading in
the frame drops it entirely. The character is decorative and stacking is the
only way to fit the text, but the two treatments are inconsistent with each
other.

### Wide screens leave the content column looking empty

With the reading measure capped at 68 characters, a 1440px window shows roughly
590px of text and 375px of empty space to its right. It is deliberate, and it
will look better with real content, but at present the page reads as sparse on a
large monitor.

### The frame is not a square

The brief calls the content container a square. It is a bordered box inset from
the viewport edges, and its proportions follow the window. See
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for why.

### The control alignment depends on a duplicated padding value

The last control's negative right margin has to equal the button's own padding
for the icon to line up with the text below it. The padding is set in the MUI
theme and the margin in the stylesheet, both as `var(--space-2)`. They agree
today because they name the same token, but nothing fails if one is changed
alone.

### The frame depends on `backdrop-filter`

The frame is translucent over the sky or the deep-space glows, and relies on
`backdrop-filter` to blur what sits behind the text. A browser without it — or
with it disabled for performance — shows the background unblurred through the
frame. Text still clears AA against the composited colour, but the brighter
patches sit directly behind the prose.

### The heading and the controls share one row with no wrap

The frame's header is a flex row: heading left, controls right. The heading is
allowed to shrink and wrap, but at a very narrow width with a long enough
translated role, the two could still meet. Nothing enforces a minimum gap.

### Entrance animations leave elements invisible while paused

The heading, navigation and frame all start at `opacity: 0` and are revealed by
a CSS animation. A browser that pauses animations — Chrome does this for tabs
that are never painted — leaves those elements invisible rather than showing
them unanimated. It resolves as soon as the tab is displayed, so a real visitor
is unlikely to see it, but automated screenshots of a hidden viewport catch it
consistently.

## Accessibility

### The content panel is always a tab stop

`tabindex="0"` is set on the content panel unconditionally so it can be scrolled
with the keyboard. When the section is short enough not to scroll, that is a tab
stop that does nothing.

---

## Hosting

### Deep links depend on the Netlify redirect

`/experience` only resolves because of the catch-all rule in `netlify.toml`.
Opening `dist/index.html` from the filesystem, or serving `dist` with a static
server that has no SPA fallback, gives a 404 on every path except `/`.

### Client-side rendering only

The HTML served to a crawler contains an empty `<div id="root">`. Search engines
that execute JavaScript will index the page; those that do not will see nothing.
