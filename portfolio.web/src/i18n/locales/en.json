    "description": "Hey! ðŸ‘‹\nI'm a Team Lead at DocuWare, and a Software Engineer at heart.\n\nI believe in the power of teamwork and live by the motto: \n<i>\"If I made someone's life better, then it was worth it.\"</i>\n\nWhether it's a small feature or a complex project, I aim to ensure that everything we create makes a positive difference for both my colleagues and our customers.\n\nI'm learning the ways of leading a team. Leadership is something I always enjoyed, as it allows me to impact the team's success and support my colleagues in achieving their professional and personal goals.\n\nOn the Software Engineering side, I have the most fun in frontend development, particularly with <b>React</b>, but I have always worked with full stack development, mostly with <b>C#</b> (and <b>.NET</b>), <b>Microsoft SQL</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>.\nOver the years, I've also gained experience with <b>CI/CD</b>, automated pipelines, <b>Infrastructure as Code</b>, <b>Terraform</b> and <b>Microsoft Azure</b>."
