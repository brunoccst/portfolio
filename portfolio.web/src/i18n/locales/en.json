    "description": "Hey! ðŸ‘‹\nIâ€™m a Team Lead at DocuWare, and a Software Engineer at heart.\n\nI like to drink mate ðŸ§‰, discover new bands ðŸŽ¸ and code. ðŸ’»\n\nI like to think that if I made someoneâ€™s life better, then it was worth it.\nWhether itâ€™s a small feature or a complex project, I aim to ensure that everything we create makes a positive difference for both my colleagues and our customers.\n\nI'm learning the ways of leading a team and I fully believe in the power of teamwork. I hope that I impact the team's success positively and that I can support my colleagues in achieving their professional and personal goals.\n\nOn the Software Engineering side, I have the most fun in frontend development, particularly with React, but I have always worked with full stack development, mostly with .NET, Microsoft SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.\nOver the years, Iâ€™ve also gained experience with CI/CD, automated pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, Terraform and Microsoft Azure.\n\n<i>Note: This portfolio was created as a personal experiment to explore building code with the help of AI, specifically using CursorAI.</i>"
