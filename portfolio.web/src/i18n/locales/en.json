Leadership is something I always enjoyed, as it allows me to impact the team's success and support my colleagues in achieving their professional and personal goals.\n\nOn the Software Engineering side, I have the most fun in frontend development, particularly with React, but I have always worked with full stack development, mostly with C# (and .NET), Microsoft SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\nOver the years, I've also gained experience with CI/CD, automated pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, Terraform and Microsoft Azure."
